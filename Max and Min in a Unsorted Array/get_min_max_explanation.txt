Get Min And Max Analysis:

I used to variable to keep track of the min and max values,
and initialized them with the first entry of the ints array.

I used linear search to traverse the array from second index to the last one 
For each integer, I compared them against stored min value or max value and updated them when conditions are met

Time Complexity: O(n) as I looped through the array once

Space Complexity: O(1) as no special data structures were used array lookups
