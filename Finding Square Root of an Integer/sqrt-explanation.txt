Square Root Calculation Analysis:

I Used binary search algorithm to split problem into smaller problems.
The Idea behind finding a square root of a number is to
find the mid point between the upper bound and lower bound
Then we should discard either the upper half or the lower half
depending on the value of the calculated mid  multiplied by itself.
Eventually we should to figure out the floor value of the approximate square root

Time Complexity: O(log(n)) as I used binary search to find the square root
Space Complexity:  O(1) as I used no special data structure to implement this algorithm
